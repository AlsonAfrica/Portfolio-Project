        "Collaborating with my partner on this app was an enriching experience. We divided our tasks based on our strengths, with me focusing on frontend design and backend logic for the restaurant app while my partner handled backend logic and front end logic for the CMS side of the app",
        "We maintained consistent communication using Slack to track progress and GitHub for version control",
        "One challenge we faced was integrating different API's to ensure that both the cms and the restaurant app communicate effeciently with the database and amongst each other",
        "I learned a lot about backend architecture from my partner, and they appreciated my user-focused design approach",
        "Our mutual support and shared commitment to the project made the experience both productive and enjoyable"
